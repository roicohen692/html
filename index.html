		<p>Hi, I'm Roi.<br> In the late 1980s, I received an ATARI TV game as a birthday present.<br> From the very first moment, I was captivated by this enchanting device.<br> I would spend hours sitting and playing. As the 1990s unfolded, games evolved, and newer consoles began to emerge,<br> such as Sega, Nintendo, Megason, and the PlayStation1.<br>

As the 2000s dawned, the PlayStation 2, 3, and Xbox made their entrance.<br> Today, we have the Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and more.<br> The new games are astonishingly innovative. Graphics and speed have advanced, and each game comes with its own narrative.<br>

Throughout my life, my enthusiasm for gaming waned,<br> and I found little time to indulge in it.<br> I got married, and the consoles took a backseat.<br> Then, on my oldest son's seventh birthday, I gifted him the Sony 3. <br>I immediately witnessed the gleam in his eyes as he played Call of Duty for the first time.<br> It was the same kind of spark I experienced back in the 1980s with the ATARI.<br>

Considering all of this, I invite you to discover some of the finest games we have enjoyed.<br> Embrace Roi's recommendations!<br>

		<p> Assassin's Creed Valhalla <br> The historical murder series is back with a bang with Assassin's Creed Valhalla,<br> putting your in the fur-lined shoes of Viking clan leader Eivor.<br>
		Build a new settlement in ye olde England,<br> bring down kings to forge alliances,<br> and travel with your longship crew to plunder <br>the towns and monasteries of Mercia.<br>

		There's rarely been a better match for the universe's<br> lore than the Viking legends either,<br> so you can expect some very interesting tangents as you <br>explore the mysteries of Anglo Saxon England,<br> try to appease the pagan gods, and go on special dream quests.<br> There's a reason the world has been obsessed with Vikings since they first went pillaging,<br> and Valhalla only makes us love them more.<br>  </p>

		<p>Guardians of the Galaxy -<br>  We didn't think it was possible for Eidos Montreal to do its own take<br> on the infamous Marvel space pirates,<br> but with Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy it has done just that.<br>
		You play as Star-Lord, who is leading an early version of the Guardians,<br> just a few years into the crew's life together.<br>
		In this version, they've all just survived an intergalactic war, <br>with Groot, Rocket, Gamora, and Draxx all coming with their own tales of loss and woe,<br> with almost alt-history backstories.<br>
		At its heart, this single-player adventure is about learning to operate as a team,<br> both in exploration and combat, and realising that friends can be just as close as family.<br> </p>
